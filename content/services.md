### Development | Infrastructure | Training

Flax & Teal is a consultancy focused on openly-licensed technologies, serving public and private sector through web-based products and services in computational engineering, geospatial analysis and data science.

_Flax & Teal builds tools for private and public sector including publicly-shared, reusable parts - these are often web platforms providing behind-the-scenes analysis of open data, geography and physics._

F&T is also part of a multidisciplinary consortium of small businesses in Northern Ireland: [Avata Industries](https://avata.industries),
which together build openly-licensed products.

## R&amp;D Software Development

### Web | Data | Engineering | Science

<sub>Recommended project budget: £20,000 - £200,000 (ex VAT)</sub>

Flax &amp; Teal has coordinated and driven a number of complex client projects since 2013, and supported others. We can build complex applications ourselves or, for large projects, draw together a multidisciplinary team from across the Avata Industries group.

Flax &amp; Teal has in-house experience supporting projects funded under EU and InnovateUK R&amp;D frameworks; coordination of work packages involving training, software development, data analysis, focus groups and design.

We work with organizations in the UK, Ireland, continental EU and Australasia.

_Sustainably Open: we contribute non-commercially sensitive code back to projects we build on top of, where relevant, and are keen to work with clients open to this principle._

## Cloud &amp; Infrastructure

### AWS | Google | Azure

Flax &amp; Teal can provide on-going hosting and data processor services within the EU, following on from our software development services, supporting our open source products, or as a standalone service.

_We have extensive experience working with Linux, Kubernetes and containerization spanning all major platforms, with a five-figure annual spend on cloud resources._

We offer a range of service agreements to maintain, secure and upgrade software over its lifetime, rapidly incorporating security improvements and critical fixes from third-party components on your behalf.

## Training &amp; Consultancy

### Data | Python | Kubernetes

Flax &amp; Teal has established introductory courses on Kubernetes (infrastructure), Data Science and Python, covering topics such as Data Analysis, Engineering, Machine Learning, Visualization, Geospatial and Fluid Dynamics.

_Phil Weir has run costed conference and on-site research-level workshops in NI &amp; Scotland, with exceptional feedback and repeat requests._

All training materials we produce are openly available and shareable, with our recurring engagements driven entirely by the quality and expertise of our delivery.
